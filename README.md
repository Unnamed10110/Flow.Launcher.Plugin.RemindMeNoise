# Remind me Noisy

This is a mod of the plugin RemindMe for Flow Launcher.
This adds the following functions:
- Increases the size of Always-on-top window notification, to make it more noticeable.
- Makes the always-on-top window notification sound (three times)
- Now it pases this format "dd/MM/yy, HH:mm to <-message->"

# Examples (I use "rm add" as shortcut, the default is "reminder add")

- Then it shows this windows over all others, always on top (it does not go away unless you close it) and sounds three times.
