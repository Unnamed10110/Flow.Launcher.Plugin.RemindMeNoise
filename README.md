# Remind me

This is a [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) plugin to remind you of something at a
specific time. Please note that it will not work if you close Flow Launcher. It also doesn't persist reminders across
Flow Launcher restarts. Don't use this for anything important.
