# Remind me

This is a [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) plugin to remind you of something at a
specific time. Please note that it will not work if you close Flow Launcher. Also, the feature for persisting
reminders between Flow Launcher restarts hasn't been thoroughly tested. Don't use this for anything important.
